In this case, we're trying to predict whether a flight is going to be late or not, so this is an example of a *classification* problem.

It is also common to *normalize* continuous numeric features to use a common scale - for example, by scaling all numbers to a proportional decimal value between 0 and 1 (strictly speaking, it only really makes sense to do this when you have multiple numeric columns - normalizing them all to similar scales prevents a feature with particularly large values from dominating the training of the model - in this case, we only have one non-categorical numeric feature; but we've included this so you can see how it's done!).\n",
