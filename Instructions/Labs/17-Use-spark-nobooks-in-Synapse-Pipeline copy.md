## Use spark notebooks in Synapse Pipeline

## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to create a parquet file using the Azure Synapse Pipeline and a Azure Synapse Notebook which we created earlier to create a parquet file passing the runId of the pipeline as the name of the folder in which the contents are stored.

This lab will take approximately **45** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

## Provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

You'll need an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace with access to data lake storage. You can use the built-in serverless SQL pool to query files in the data lake.

In this exercise, you'll use a combination of a PowerShell script and an ARM template to provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment and creating storage if prompted. The Cloud Shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    ![Azure portal with a cloud shell pane](./images/cloud-shell.png)

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, use the the drop-down menu at the top left of the cloud shell pane to change it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that Cloud Shell can be resized by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the—, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone this repository:

    ```powershell
    rm -r dp-000 -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-synapse dp-000
    ```

5. After the repository has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab, and run the **setup.ps1** script it contains:

    ```powershell
    cd dp-000/Allfiles/Labs/17
    ./setup.ps1
    ```
    
6. If prompted, choose which subscription you want to use (this will only happen if you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions).
7. When prompted, enter a suitable password to be set for your Azure Synapse SQL pool.

    > **Note**: Be sure to remember this password!

8. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 10 minutes, but in some cases may take longer. While you're waiting, review the [Azure Synapse Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-performance-pipelines) article in the Azure Synapse Analytics documentation.

## View and Navigate Synapse Workspace

1. After the script has completed, in the Azure portal, go to the dp000-xxxxxxx resource group that it created, and select your Synapse workspace.
2. In the **Overview** page for your Synapse Workspace, in the **Open Synapse Studio** card, select **Open** to open Synapse Studio in a new browser tab; signing in if prompted.
3. On the left side of Synapse Studio, use the ›› icon to expand the menu - this reveals the different pages within Synapse Studio that you’ll use to manage resources and perform data analytics tasks.
4. On the **Data** page, view the Linked tab and verify that your workspace includes a link to your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account, which should have a name similar to **synapsexxxxxxx (Primary - datalakexxxxxxx)**.
5. Expand your storage account and verify that it contains a file system container named **files (primary)**.
6. Select the files container, and note that it contains folders named data and synapse. The synapse folder is used by Azure Synapse, and the data folder contains the data files you're going to query.
Open the sales folder and the orders folder it contains, and observe the files contained within it.
***Right-click*** any of the files and select Preview to see the data it contains. Note if the files contain a header row, so you can determine whether to select the option to display column headers.
## Execute a notebook in an Azure Synapse Pipeline

Earlier in a lab we created a Synapse Notebook and created some tables. We're going to return back to that notebook and add some code that allows us to call and run a step within the notebook as part of our pipeline using a parameter.
## Create a parameter cell

1. On the **Develop** tab, select the notebook named **Spark Transform**
2. in the Right panel of the **Spark Transform** notebook, click on the drop-down box to the right of the **Attach to**
3. Select **sparkxxxxxxx** replacing the "x" elements with the suffix assigned in your setup script
4. Below the section in the notebook named **Load Source Data** and below the code block that populates the ***order_details*** python dataframe, click on the **+ Code**.
5. Type or paste the following commands into the new code window.

```python
# We're going to use this for integration into a Synapse Pipleline
import uuid

#generates a random GUID
runId = uuid.uuid4()
print("Your parquet file to be created: " + str(runId))
```

    > **Note**: This cell services two purposes, firstly, it establishes a filename if it's run from within the notebook. Secondly, it defines a placeholder for the pipeline job to populate when running from an Azure Synapse pipeline run.

4. Mouse-over the code and, select the **...** ellipse on the right-side of the code block then select **Toggle parameter cell**. You'll notice the text ***parameters*** now appear in the bottom-right or top-right corner of the code block.

    ![Changing uuid to a parameter](images/select-as-parameter.png)

5. Below this code block select the **+ Code** to create another code block.
6. Type or paste the following commands into the new window

```python
%%pyspark

order_details.write.parquet('abfss://files@datalakexxxxxxx.dfs.core.windows.net/data/order_details/' + str(runId) + '.parquet')
```

7. Replace the text in the new code **datalakexxxxxxx** with the name of the data lake within your **Resource Group** during the lab build.
8. We can now remove all of the other code and markdown cells below this text.

    > **Note**: If you leave the other objects, the notebook will still run; however, it will create those objects within the Data lake as it did in the prior lab as the pipeline is running the entire notebook.

9.  On the top right of the notebook pane, select the pipeline icon.
10. select the **New pipeline** option.

## Within the Pipeline ##

In this particular case, we're going to run the notebook and pass the name as the package's runId for traceability. How you run a notebook in your organization will likely be different. 

1. From the prior step you should now see a new ***Pipeline 1*** which we'll rename to ***Run Spark Transform notebook***

    ![Change pipeline name](images/rename-notebook-pipeline.png)

2. Select the **Notebook** on the canvas and then select the **Settings** tab.
3. Expand **Base parameters** under the **Settings** tab.
4. Select the **+New** option and fill in the following information
   Name: **runId**
   Type: String
   Value: Select ***Add dynamic content [Alt+Shift+D]***
   **Pipeline Expression Builder**:  Select ***System variables***, select ***Pipeline run ID***
The resulting settings should look like the image below:

   ![Pipeline parameter settings](images/set-pipeline-parameter.png)

5. Navigate to the **Data** tab and select the **Linked** tab.
6. Expand **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.
7. Expand the **synapsexxxxxxx (Primary - datalakexxxxxxx)** that matches your generated suffix.
8. Select **files (primary)**. You'll note three files (***2019.csv, 2020.csv, 2021.csv***) in the **data** folder.
9. Select the **Pipeline** ***Run Spark Transform Notebook***.
10. Press the **Debug button** which will take you to the **Output** tab.
    
    > **Note**: This **Output** tab will continue to refresh every 20 seconds for 5 minutes as the default.

11. Take note of the **Pipeline run ID:** and monitor the **Status**

    ![monitor pipeline status](images/monitor-pipeline-notebook-status.png)

12. Once the **Status** turns green with the words ***succeeded***, navigate to the **files** tab
13. You should see a folder named **order_details** underneath the **data** tab, which may require a refresh.
14. Select this **order_details** folder and you'll see a folder with the **runId** which was passed from the Pipeline to the notebook, which created output in a parquet format.

### Validate the Results ###

1. To validate the data was properly loaded through the pipeline, Select the **New SQL Script** dropdown.
2. Select ***Select TOP 100 rows*** as shown below

    ![Select parquet results](images/validate-parquet-notebook.png)

3. in the **Select TOP 100 rows** ***File type*** panel, select ***parquet***, then select **Apply**.
4. Select the **Run** button.

## Delete Azure resources

If you've finished exploring Azure Synapse Analytics, you should delete the resources you've created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Synapse Studio browser tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. On the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **dp000-*xxxxxxx*** resource group for your Synapse Analytics workspace (not the managed resource group), and verify that it contains the Synapse workspace, storage account, and Spark pool for your workspace.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the **dp000-*xxxxxxx*** resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

    After a few minutes, your Azure Synapse workspace resource group and the managed workspace resource group associated with it will be deleted.
